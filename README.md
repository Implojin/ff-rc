## ff.rc : A dungeon crawl script

> *"Wake me up when we get to the good part."*
>
> Have you ever thought, "Hey, I *want* to like Crawl, but it really only takes like 5 keys and pressing them is pretty boring"?
>
> Do pillardancing and breadswinging take more effort than you want to put in?
>
> Do you tend to mash 'o tab' until 'o shit' happens?
>
> Maybe you'd like it if the game was a little more bite-sized. Closer to coffeebreak duration?
>
> Or maybe you'd have more fun if playing the game didn't involve things like food, stairs, and dropping items all the time.
>
> Are you the kind of person who unironically wants to automate dumb stuff like excluding every tile you've stepped on?
> (At least until the devteam removes it?)
>
> What if you could get some chump to write the ancient, cursed crawl Lua, so that **YOU** don't have to?
>
> *"It's MY interesting tactical combat, and I WANT IT NOW."*
